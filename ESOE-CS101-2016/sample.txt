Who can turn the tides?

The us military has suffered its 2,000th death in the Afghan war - with a suspected  insider  attack at a checkpoint in the east of the country.

A us soldier and a foreign contractor were killed while two Afghan soldiers died and four were injured.

The nationality of the contractor was not given immediately.

Attacks by rogue elements in the Afghan security forces will sharply increase this year, prompting the coalition to suspend joint operations this month.

Requests for joint operations must now be approved by regional commanders.

The American death toll goes back to the us-led invasion of Afghanistan in 2001.
